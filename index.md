## About Me

**I am taking students to be co-advised with Mila faculty members for 2025.**
**If you are interested, reach out over e-mail with a research problem and list of 3 suggested faculty members.**

I am currently a Research Scientist at the Interactive & Embodied group within the Machine Learning Research team at Apple, working with Alex Toshev on solving fundamental sequential decision making problems using large generative models.

I defended my PhD at the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (Mila) and McGill University in December 2022, co-supervised by [Devon Hjelm](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=68c5HfwAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Doina Precup](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=j54VcVEAAAAJ&hl=en).


## Research Interests

- **Reinforcement learning:** exploration, representation learning, generalization.
- **Generative Models::** large language models, diffusion models and applications to reinforcement learning.
