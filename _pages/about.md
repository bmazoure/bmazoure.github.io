# About me

I am currently a PhD student at the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA) and McGill University, co-supervised by [Devon Hjelm](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=68c5HfwAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Doina Precup](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=j54VcVEAAAAJ&hl=en). My research interests include deep reinforcement learning, probabilistic modeling, variational inference and representation learning.

I am currently a student researcher at Google Brain, working with [Jonathan Tompson](https://jonathantompson.github.io/) and [Ofir Nachum](https://research.google/people/105364/) on unsupervised pre-training of state representations for efficient RL finetuning.

In the summer of 2021, I was interning in the Robotics team at Google Brain, with [Jonathan Tompson](https://jonathantompson.github.io/) and [Ofir Nachum](https://research.google/people/105364/), working on using self-supervised learning to improve generalization capabilities of offline RL agents.
I was a research intern at Microsoft Research, New York in the reinforcement learning team during summer 2020, working on counterfactual evaluation in contextual bandits. Previously, I was a research intern at Microsoft Research Montreal in the reinforcement learning team during summer 2019. I was also a research intern at Nuance during the summer of 2018 where I collaborated with [Atta Norouzian](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=KRPMXqYAAAAJ&hl=en). My work there focused on modeling acoustic signals such as speech with deep neural architectures.

I have completed my Master's in Statistics at McGill University under the supervision of [Johanna Neslehova](http://www.math.mcgill.ca/neslehova/). My thesis focused on reconstructing graphical models from discrete data with variational inference and multiarmed bandits. It can be found here: [link](https://bmazoure.github.io/files/thesis_Msc_2018.pdf). Before that, I obtained a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Statistics in 2017 from McGill University.
